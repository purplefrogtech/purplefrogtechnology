                    <span style="font-weight: 700;">Vision:</span> PurpleFrog Technology AI is a technology company
                    aiming to produce innovative solutions in critical technological fields such as software, hardware,
                    healthcare, blockchain, gaming, education, media, and defense by harnessing the power of artificial
                    intelligence. The company aspires to lead ventures that will shape the next century and also
                    contribute to the industry through technology-focused social events, digital content, and awareness
                    projects. PurpleFrog Technology adopts a mission to strengthen trends and support sustainable
                    development as a new-generation leader in technology production, trade, and R&D activities.
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Our Inspiration:</span> Necmettin Erbakan’s words, “We will develop a
                    technology and turn their weapons back on them,” teach us to view technology not just as a tool but
                    as a strategic power that balances civilizations. This perspective emphasizes not merely reproducing
                    or imitating existing technologies but developing original, innovative, and sustainable solutions.

                    Today, we observe the rapid progress of the global technological race. In this race, it’s not enough
                    to stay behind existing players; we must move forward with a different vision and strategy.
                    Imitation will not propel us forward in this field; only through innovation and courage can we
                    secure our place on the world stage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Erbakan’s statement, “If you say they are building ships, so let us build ships too, by the time
                    we’ve built 40, they will have built 80,” highlights the importance of moving beyond imitation and
                    adopting a new mindset. We must aim to become leaders in directing technology, not just followers.
                    For this reason, our company’s core mission is not just to improve existing solutions but to create
                    innovations that shape the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have adopted the principles of working for the benefit of humanity, viewing technology as a
                    blessing, and using this blessing on the right path. Every step we take today in areas such as
                    artificial intelligence, sustainable energy solutions, advanced manufacturing technologies, and
                    digital transformation turns us into not just a company but also a bearer of a mission. We use
                    technology as a tool to simplify life, spread justice, and enhance human well-being. In doing so, we
                    aim not only to empower ourselves but also the communities around us. We believe that the strength
                    of a nation is directly proportional to its technological productivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our company aims to go beyond merely keeping up with global technological trends to become a key
                    player that creates its own dynamics and shapes the industry. Every solution we produce is designed
                    to be a part of significant changes in the future and to drive these changes forward.

                    This journey for us is shaped by the inspiration we draw from visionary leaders like Necmettin
                    Erbakan. His ideas remind us at every step how essential it is to see technology not just as a
                    product but as a civilization project. Now is the time to shape the future together!

                    Let us remember: It’s not imitators who win but those who are original. Those who produce technology
                    shape not only today but also tomorrow.
